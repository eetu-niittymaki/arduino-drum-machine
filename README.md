# Arduino Drum Machine

A sample based drum machine made with an Arduino Mega and using the Mozzi (https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/) library.
An Arduino nano is also used to control a small (0,96 inch) OLED screen.

## Features:

- Four channels with three different samples on each to choose from
- Max step control on channel (1 - 16) and how densely beats are played in relation to max steps
- Individual channel pitch control
- Individual channel and master volume control
- Swing/shuffle control
- Tempo control
- Tap tempo
- Highpass, bandpass and lowpass filters
- OLED screen that displays BPM, what samples are selected on what channels and if playback is on
- A python script to convert .wav samples to .h files usable by Arduino
